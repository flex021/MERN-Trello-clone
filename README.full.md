This project uses **email-based account verification with JWT authentication**:

1. **Registration** ‚Äì User registers with email and password via the frontend form.  
2. **Email Verification** ‚Äì Backend generates a unique token and sends a verification email via **Brevo** containing an activation link.  
3. **Account Activation** ‚Äì User clicks the link; backend validates the token and marks the account as active in **MongoDB**.  
4. **Login & JWT Issuance** ‚Äì Activated users can log in. Backend validates credentials and issues a signed **JWT**.  
5. **Session Handling** ‚Äì Frontend stores JWT securely (local storage) and attaches it to subsequent API requests (e.g., board creation, invitations).  
6. **Profile Security** ‚Äì Protected actions such as password change, avatar upload, or updating display name require JWT validation.  
7. **Logout** ‚Äì Frontend clears JWT and local storage, ending the session.
