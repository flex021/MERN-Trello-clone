## Overview

This project is a **Trello clone built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)**, featuring real-time collaboration, drag-and-drop interfaces, and secure email-based authentication. Designed to demonstrate modern web development skills, it replicates core Trello functionalities like board management, column/card organization, and team invitations, with a focus on user experience and scalability.

**Architecture:**
- **Frontend**: React application with Vite bundler ([https://trello-web-eight-self.vercel.app](https://trello-web-eight-self.vercel.app))
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express API server with MongoDB ([https://trello-ideft-api.onrender.com](https://trello-ideft-api.onrender.com))

**Key Features:**
- 📧 Email registration with Brevo verification (link activation required before login)
- 🌙 Theme modes: Dark, Light, and System (follows device preference)
- 📊 Board management: Create new boards, search boards, delete boards
- 👥 Profile settings: Security (password change), Account (update display name, upload avatar via Cloudinary)
- 🤝 Real-time invitations: Invite users by email with Socket.IO for accept/reject notifications
- 🧩 Drag-and-drop columns and cards using @dnd-kit for smooth interactions
- 🃏 Card details: Add cover images, assign members, descriptions, comments, rename, and delete
- 🔐 JWT-based authentication for secure sessions
- 📱 Responsive UI with Material-UI components
- 🔔 Real-time updates and notifications with React Toastify

## Technical Highlights

- Implemented real-time collaboration using Socket.IO for invitation handling and live updates
- Leveraged @dnd-kit for accessible, performant drag-and-drop across columns and cards
- Integrated Brevo for secure email verification and Cloudinary for avatar/cover uploads
- Managed global state with Redux Toolkit and Redux Persist for persistent user data
- Ensured secure file handling with Multer and validation using Joi

## Technical Implementation

**Frontend** (`http://localhost:5173`)
```bash
cd trell-web
yarn install
yarn dev
```

**Backend** (`http://localhost:8017`)
```bash
cd trello-api
yarn install
yarn dev
```

**Technology Stack:**
- **Frontend**: React 18.2.0, Vite 5.2.0, Material-UI 5.13.0, @dnd-kit/core 6.0.8, Redux Toolkit 2.0.1
- **Backend**: Node.js 18.16.0, Express 4.18.2, MongoDB 6.0.0, Babel transpilation
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (jsonwebtoken 9.0.2), Brevo (@getbrevo/brevo 2.0.0-beta.4)
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO 4.7.4
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend), Render (backend)

## Authentication Flow

This project uses **email-based account verification with JWT authentication**:

1. **Registration** – User registers with email and password via the frontend form.  
2. **Email Verification** – Backend generates a unique token and sends a verification email via **Brevo** containing an activation link.  
3. **Account Activation** – User clicks the link; backend validates the token and marks the account as active in **MongoDB**.  
4. **Login & JWT Issuance** – Activated users can log in. Backend validates credentials and issues a signed **JWT**.  
5. **Session Handling** – Frontend stores JWT securely (local storage) and attaches it to subsequent API requests (e.g., board creation, invitations).  
6. **Profile Security** – Protected actions such as password change, avatar upload, or updating display name require JWT validation.  
7. **Logout** – Frontend clears JWT and local storage, ending the session.  


**Demo Users**

**User Flow Summary:**



This project uses **email-based account verification with JWT authentication**. The flow is as follows:

    subgraph Registration
        A[Open Frontend] --> B{Signup or Login?}
        B -->|Signup| C[Email Signup]
        C --> D[Brevo Email]
        D --> E[Activate Link]
        E --> F[Account Activated]
    end
    subgraph Login & Profile
        F --> G[Login]
        B -->|Login| G
        G --> H{Valid?}
        H -->|No| I[Error: Invalid/Inactive]
        H -->|Yes| J[Get JWT]
        J --> K[Store JWT]
        K --> L[Update Profile]
        G --> M[Logout]
    end
```




- **Registration** → Email sent → Activate link → Account ready  
- **Login** → JWT issued → Access boards/profile  
- **Invitation** → Real-time Socket.IO notification → Accept/Reject → Shared board access
